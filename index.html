    Insert the information in the form and the calculator will determine the retention rate<br> 
    What is the retention rate?<br>
    retention rate is the percentage of costumers who stayed active or a memeber of your business in a given time period.<br>
    How to calculate retention rate?<br>
    To calculate retention rate you should use the following formula:<br>
    retention rate = (remaining head count during set periods / starting head count during set perio) * 100<br>
    example: Kevin is the owner of a tech start up, on the first day of the month, he had 16 employees and on the last day of the month he had only 13, what is the retention rate of kevin's company?<br>
    using the retention rate formula the answer will be:<br>
    retention rate = (remaining head count during set periods / starting head count during set period) * 100<br>
    retention rate = (13 / 16) * 100<br>
    retention rate = 81.25%<br>
    Why use retention rate?<br>
    Retention rate is used to measure the profits and growth, if the retention rate exceeds the rate of acquisition your product gains customers and eventually revenue, but if the retention rate is less than the acquisition rate then you lose customers.<br>
